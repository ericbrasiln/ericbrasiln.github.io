## ferramentas_scielo_v2

[**Access the tool here**](https://labhdufba.github.io/ferramentas_scielo_v2/)

Collection tool developed by members of LABHDUFBA and aimed at scraping, organizing and analyzing scientific articles published on the Scielo.br platform.

In this version of the program, we rebuilt the code to deal with the new version of the Scielo.br repository.

Now, we use Selenium to access and scrape the data from the repository.

It is still possible to choose to perform the scraping by area of knowledge or by journal (or a list of journals). In this last option, it is necessary to provide the abbreviation of the journal's name according to the Scielo.br website.
